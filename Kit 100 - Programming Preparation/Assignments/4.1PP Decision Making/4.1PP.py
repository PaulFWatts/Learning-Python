This program asks the user to enter an objectâ€™s weight in Newtons, and then calculates and displays its mass in kilograms. If the object's calculated mass is more than 500 kilograms, it displays a message indicating that it is too heavy. If the object's mass is less than 100 kilograms, it displays a message indicating that it is too light.

# Initialise variables
ACCELERATION = 9.8 # Acceleration due to gravity
weight = 0.0    # Weight in Newtons
mass = 0.0      # Mass in Kilograms

print ("\033[2J\033[1;1H") # clear screen

# Obtain weight from user  
weight = float(input("Enter the weight of the object in Newtons: "))

# Calculate mass in kilograms
mass = weight / ACCELERATION

# Display mass in kilograms (rounded to 2 decimal places), test for too light and too heavy
if mass > 500:
    print ("The object's mass is ", round(mass,2), " kilograms, which is too heavy.")
elif mass < 100:
    print ("The object's mass is ", round(mass,2), " kilograms, which is too light.")
else:
    print ("The object's mass is", round(mass,2), "kilograms.")

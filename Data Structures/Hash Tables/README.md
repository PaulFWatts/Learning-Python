In this program, we start with a docstring that provides an explanation of the program and its purpose. It describes hash tables as collections of key-value pairs and highlights that in Python, hash tables are implemented using dictionaries.

The program then proceeds to demonstrate various operations on hash tables. It creates an empty hash table using an empty dictionary `{}` and adds elements to the hash table by assigning key-value pairs.

The program showcases accessing elements in the hash table by retrieving values associated with specific keys using the square bracket notation (`[]`).

It checks if a key exists in the hash table using the `in` operator and prints the corresponding message accordingly.

The program also demonstrates updating a value in the hash table by assigning a new value to an existing key. It showcases removing a key-value pair from the hash table using the `del` statement.

Finally, the program illustrates iterating over the hash table using the `items()` method, which returns a sequence of key-value pairs. It loops over these pairs and prints each key-value pair.
